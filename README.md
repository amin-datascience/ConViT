# Convolutional-Vision-Transformer (ConViT)

This is the pytorch code for ConViT(Improving Vision Transformers with Soft Convolutional Inductive Biases), which is one of the recent vision transformers that is more data efficient compared to the original Vision Transformer(ViT). 
We have trained this model using the CIFAR10 dataset to furhter validate the data efficiency of this model.
